# How to create HTML

There are several hundert ways how you could create HTML.

I have not found the perfect way yet.

This page contains some ways to create html programmatically.

# Python 

* https://github.com/Knio/dominate
* https://github.com/basxsoftwareassociation/htmlgenerator
* https://github.com/ejplatform/hyperpython
* [format_html()](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/utils/#django.utils.html.format_html)
* Django Templates
* Jinja Templates
* [Template Literals](https://github.com/guettli/peps/blob/master/pep-9999.rst)

# php

I think for a lot of use-cases php is a good solution, although I prefer Python.

# jsonnet like 

[jsonnet](https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet) is a language inside json to create json.

Something like this could be cool. But it should be a bit better than php.

# golang

I would love to have such a great templating solution for Python: [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template)

# Conclusion

My current prefered way is Django's [format_html()](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/utils/#django.utils.html.format_html)
